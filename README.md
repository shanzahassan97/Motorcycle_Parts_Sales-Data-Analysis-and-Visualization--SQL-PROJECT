# Motorcycle Parts Sales Data Analysis and Visualization - SQL Project

## üìä About the Project
This project delves into the sales data of a company specializing in motorcycle parts. By focusing on wholesale sales across three key warehouse locations, we aim to uncover insights into the company's revenue streams. Our goal is to determine the net revenue generated each month for various product lines at each warehouse, providing a clear view of sales performance and profitability.

## üéØ Project Purpose
The primary objective of this project is to empower the company with a deeper understanding of its revenue streams. By meticulously analyzing sales performance across different product lines and warehouse locations, we can:

- **Identify sales trends** across months and locations.
- **Evaluate the profitability** of different product lines.
- **Inform data-driven decisions** to optimize operations and sales strategies.

With these insights, the company can sharpen its focus on the most profitable areas and make informed adjustments to enhance overall sales performance.

## üìÅ About the Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis comprises detailed sales transactions of motorcycle parts. Below are the key columns included in the dataset:

- **`order_number`**: A unique identifier for each order.
- **`date`**: The date when the order was placed.
- **`warehouse`**: The location of the warehouse where the product was sold (e.g., North).
- **`client_type`**: The type of client (e.g., Retail, Wholesale).
- **`product_line`**: The category of the motorcycle part sold (e.g., Braking system, Suspension & traction).

- **`unit_price`**: The price per unit of the product.
- **`total`**: The total revenue generated from the sale.
- **`payment`**: The method of payment used (e.g., Cash, Credit card, Transfer).
- **`payment_fee`**: The fee associated with the payment method.

This rich dataset allows us to conduct a thorough analysis and create meaningful visualizations that will highlight key insights and trends.
